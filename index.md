> My name is Royce Labuguen and I am an aspiring software engineer. I am pursuing my degree in computer science at the University of California, San Diego. 

## **As a programmer:**
My first and favorite programming language is C++, thus I was introduced to the world of coding with the famous instruction:
```
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
```
Some of the skills that I have picked up in my educational career:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Discrete Mathematics
- Modern Algebra
- Enumerative Combinatorics
